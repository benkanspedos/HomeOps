I need to begin Stage 2 (Planning) for the HomeOps project.

## Project Context
- **Project**: HomeOps
- **Type**: fullstack
- **Description**: 
- **Path**: C:\Projects\HomeOps

## Stage 1 Outputs (Complete)
âœ… Project structure created
âœ… CLAUDE.md with context
âœ… Git repository initialized

## Stage 2 Mission
Please invoke the BMAD-PM agent to create:
1. Product Requirements Document (PRD) - 2500+ words
2. User stories with acceptance criteria
3. Epic breakdown and prioritization
4. Success metrics and KPIs

Start by reviewing:
- C:\Projects\HomeOps\CLAUDE.md for project context
- Focus on MVP features for rapid deployment
- Include revenue/monetization strategy

Begin with your planning approach.
